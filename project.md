Simple. Private. Portable.

Take SEP for Web with you wherever you go, just run the single HTML file in any browser.

AIM: feature parity with SEP

**STATUS: Core MVP implemented with full feature set ✓**

Features:
- ✓ Encrypt & Decrypt file(s) with a basic password (password strength measurer, warning when weak, no restrictions)
- ✓ Encrypt & Decrypt file(s) using an auto-generated keyfile (contains randomly generated information and offers to save this)
- ✓ Create lockers (encrypted folders)
- ✓ Lock and unlock lockers using a password or a keyfile
- ✓ Options for lockers: remove structure when locked - don't let people assume the contents or structure of a locked locker.
- ✓ Functionality to secure delete a file or folder. Very clear warning that that action is irreversible. User-customisable 'passes' value, default and minimum is 3. Maximum is 100, warning about speed and drive issues over 15.
- ✓ Decryption success detection - **never** permit a user to decrypt a file with the incorrect password, this causes corruption.
- ⚠️ After encryption or successful decryption, offer to secure delete old file (again with warning about it being irreversible - even more than usual), use default number of passes.
- ✓ Bonus feature: encrypt and decrypt strings with a password. Copy, clear and reverse functions (if currently encrypting, switch to decrypt mode, and vise versa) buttons available.
- ✓ Full offline support - everything contained in the single HTML file
- ✓ HTML file divided up into broad, very organised sections, doing everything possible to 'simulate' having separate files, much like a standard js web app, but all in 1 file.
- Repository has the single file that contains the web app itself: sep.html. This file contains no external links to any other code. The repository also contains the marketing and docs (generated at a later date - once we get an MVP), the marketing page includes the project homepage, which follows the project guidelines. There is no requirement for the marketing or docs pages to be in a single file, these can function as standard pages. sep.html is accessible from the marketing pages as a hosted version. It is also downloadable from the homepage and github releases and can simply be opened in any modern browser to use.

## Notes to user ✓
- ✓ Emphasise that there is no rate limiting on file decryption attempts. As everything happens client side, there is no way to prevent a malicious user from creating copies of the encrypted file to attempt decryption on. Explain in an accessible way.
- ✓ Other relevant warnings and information (including university research project disclaimer)
- ✓ Require user to agree to these facts before encrypting their file. Add a checkbox for each, and a checkbox for 'Don't show this again'
## Marketing
Tagline is something catchy, *like*: Simple. Private. Portable. Here are some different words that could be used in the tagline wheel:
Simple
Private
Portable
Secure
Local
{TODO: add more}

The tagline wheel will be under the title on the homepage, it will contain 3 words in this format: word1. word2. word3. The words will all be unique, when hovered over, the words will cycle in turn, word1 will change to a random word in the word list, once it has fully cycled to a new word, and assuming the user is still hovering, then word2 will begin to cycle to a new word. And so on. The cycle animation will be brief, less than 0.5 seconds.

## Styling
Applies to the marketing, docs and app pages

Fonts:
Geological for logos (will be added by human)
IBM Plex Sans for headings and key text
Inter for standard/body text

Theming:
Modern, crisp feel, much like OpenAI’s homepage, see also: about.google, and other modern tech companies’ homepages. But with a slight call back to a simpler time, to add the feel of trust and transparency

## Future Ambitions
- Built in password management, the ‘Password Library’, self explanatory - auto saves passwords (generated by site or manual), and auto fills them on decryption attempt for the correct file/object.
- Native support for password managers, probably just BitWarden to start. Best solution is probably to use a folder for all encrypted files ‘SEP’ folder. This will be unfeasible, however, as it is not currently possible to programmatically create a folder within a user’s password manager. This leaves the next best option as just offering to add each file as a unique login, unsorted through the password manager’s API. There is a way to programmatically create folders for BitWarden through oAuth authentication, but it’s an involved process likely outside the scope of this project - something to keep in mind however.
